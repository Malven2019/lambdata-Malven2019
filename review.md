As per the instructions "Find at least 2 things to compliment and at least 1 constructive criticism. "

**Compliment:** Great explanations inside the triple quotes. Helped me wrap my head around the long for loop code such
            as in the duplicate.py
Compliment: Very organized to split up into two .py's. One split and one duplicate to mark the different functions more clearly. 
Compliment: Nice function in duplicate.py. Very complicated for loop, yet commented and organized nicely

Overall, really organized despite its complicated code for doing the functions. Easy to follow and would be easy to add onto without wasting time 
figuring out what is going on. 

Criticism: Does it actually work? The __init__() is empty, and you only call numpy as np and pandas as pd, but I understand train test split requires a seperate
          sklearn package to work properly which may have to be added into the code on split.py. If I imported your package without anything else imported will
          all your functions work?
          
          * This critism may not be accurate as I didn't test out the package myself.
